[jDataView](http://blog.vjeux.com/2011/javascript/jdataview-read-binary-file.html) - A unique way to work with a binary file in JavaScript.
================================

jDataView provides convenient way to read and/or modify binary data in all the browsers. It follows the [DataView Specification](http://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/#8) and even extends it for a more practical use.

Explanation
===========

There are three ways to read a binary file from the browser.

* The first one is to download the file through XHR with [charset=x-user-defined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/using_xmlhttprequest#Receiving_binary_data). You get the file as a **String**, convert it to byte **Array** and you have to rewrite all the decoding and encoding functions (getUint16, getFloat32, ...). All the browsers support this.

* Then browsers that implemented **Canvas** also added **CanvasPixelArray** as part of **ImageData**. It is fast byte array that is created and used internally by `<canvas />` element for manipulating low-level image data. We can create such host element and use it as factory for our own instances of this array.

* Then browsers that implemented **WebGL** added **ArrayBuffer**. It is a plain buffer that can be read with views called **TypedArrays** (Int32Array, Float64Array, ...). You can use them to decode the file but this is not very handy. It has big drawback, it can't read non-aligned data (but we can actually hack that). So they replaced **CanvasPixelArray** with **Uint8ClampedArray** (same as Uint8Array, but cuts off numbers outside 0..255 range).

* A new revision of the specification added **DataViews**. It is a view around your buffer that can read/write arbitrary data types directly through functions: getUint32, getFloat64 ...

And one way to read a binary file from the server.

* **NodeJS Buffers**. They appeared in [Node 0.4.0](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.0/api/buffers.html). [Node 0.5.0](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.0/api/buffers.html) added a DataView-like API. And [Node 0.6.0](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.6.0/api/buffers.html) changed the API naming convention.

**jDataView** provides the **DataView API** with own convenient extensions using the best available option between Arrays, TypedArrays, NodeJS Buffers and DataViews.

Advanced usage ([jBinary](https://github.com/jDataView/jBinary))
========================

For complicated binary structures, it may be hard enough to use only low-level get/set operations for parsing,
processing and writing data.

In addition, most likely you might need convenient I/O methods for retrieving data from external sources such like
local files (using File API or from Node.js), remote files (via HTTP(S)), data-URIs, Node.js streams etc. as well
as for displaying generated content to user on webpage in image/video/audio/... containers
or even as simple download link.

If you faced any of these problems, you might want to check out new [jBinary](https://github.com/jDataView/jBinary)
library that works on top of **jDataView** and allows to operate with binary data in structured and convenient way.
